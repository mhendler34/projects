multiplexing: multiple signals to travel simultaneoulsy over one medium
tdm: time division multiplexing
tdm: divides channel into multiple intervals of time slots
tdm: time slots are reserved for their designated nodes
tdm: does not allow multiple signals on line at exact same time
stdm: statistical time division multiplexing
stdm: assigns time slots to nodes based on priority
tdm: does not allow multiple signals on line at exact same time
fdm: frequency division multiplexing
fdm: assigns different frequency to create multiple frequency bands
fdm: signals are modulated into different frequencies and multiplexed to travel simultaneously over single channel
fdm: allows multiple signals on line at same time
wdm: wavelength division multiplexing
wdm: carry multiple light signals simultaneously
wdm: divides light beam into different wavelengths on single fiber
wdm: one direction at a time
bidrectional wdm: supports full-duplex light transmission in both directions at same time
dwdm: dense wavelength divsion multiplexing
dwdm: increases number  of channels provided by normal wdm
dwdm: increase number of channels to 80 - 320 channels
dwdm: used on high-bandwidt or long distance WAN links
cwdm: coarse division multiplexing
cwdm: lowers cost by spacing frequency bands wider apart to allow for cheaper transceiver equipment
