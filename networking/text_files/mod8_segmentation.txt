#NETWORK SEGMENTATION#:ok
network segmentation benefit 1:enhance security
network segmentation benefit 2:improve performance
network segmentation benefit 3:simplify troubleshooting
network segmentation (2 parts): subnetting and vlan
VLAN (acronym):virtual local area network
VLAN [what is it]:group of ports on one or more switches
VLAN [why]:limit traffic to smaller broadcast domains
switch adds a small field called a [what] to Ethernet header:tag
what does the tag do:identifies port messages arrive at
port tagging is indentified in what IEEE standard:802.1q
IEEE 802.1q is also called:dot1q
after message arrives at switch tag is stripped from frame (true/false):true
## VLAN Trunks ##:ok
access port:connects switch to host
trunk port:connects switch to networking device
1 broadcast domain == 1 VLAN == 1 subnet (true/false):true
how do VLAN clients receive subnet addressing: dhcp relay agent
### Types of VLANS ###:
preconfigured on a switch, includes all the switch's ports:default vlan
receives all untagged frames from untagged ports:native vlan
carries user-generated traffic: data vlan
supports voip traffic:voice vlan
provide administrative access:management vlan
partions a VLAN broadcast domain into subdomains:private vlan
host on each port is isolated from hosts in sam and other secondary vlans:isloated vlan
hosts within the same community can communicate with each other but not other hosts in secondary vlans:community vlan
### VLAN Troubleshooting and Security ###:ok
issue #1:incorrect vlan assignment
issue #2:incorrect port mode
issue #3:vlan isolation
issue #4:vlan hopping
(Approach 1 vlan hopping)attacker generates transmission that appear to belong to a protected vlan:vlan hopping
(Approach 2 vlan hopping)hacker stacks vlan tags in ethernet frame:double tagging
attacker connects to a switch and makes connection look like it is trunk line:switch spoofing
